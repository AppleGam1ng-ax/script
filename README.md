# Crip-s-Gaming-Chair

Simple Hub :)

Loader:
```loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cripzs/Crip-s-Gaming-Chair/main/main%20loader.lua"))()```

These scripts are not open-sourced so you can just copy the loader right away: Here is our Discord here you can get help and add suggestions! https://discord.gg/A9Qbj9a37M

We switched to the "orion" libary and working now on higher quality scripts than before


The current main developer is Crip#3175
